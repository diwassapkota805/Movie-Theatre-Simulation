# Movie-Theatre-Simulation
Programming language used: C

Actions you can perform:

# See who's in line
# See the seat map for a given theater
# Print today's receipts


- Movie Theater Seat Map Files – contains the eight movie theater seat map files.

- Command Line Files.zip – contains the file of theaters and their zip codes for the BST and
the file of customers for thequeue. These are the data input files required by the program 
on the command line.

- Libraries – contains 10 files – 5 .c files and 5.h files for the libraries this assignment 
uses. They are Movie Theater, linked list, queue, stack and Binary Search Tree (BST) libraries.


./Code7_xxxxxxxxxx.e QUEUE=queue.txt ZIPFILE=zip.txt RECEIPTNUMBER=1 (This is how you run this program)
# RECEIPTNUMBER = The starting value of this run's receipt numbers.

# QUEUE = Name of the file containing a list of customer names.
